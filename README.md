# Bayesian-econometrics
The program works similar to MCMCpack (Markov Chain Monte Carlo Package). 
Contains functions to perform Bayesian inference using posterior simulation for a number of statistical models. 
Code allows: 
load a set of data (y and X matrices; for any number of explanatory variables) - from an xlsx file 
determine any number of burn-in cycles (i.e. initial draws) and proper sample cycles determining any values of hyperparameters setting any starting point for Gibbs algorithm
dump of estimation results graphs - topdf files Graphs relating to particular parameters include in the title or legendindication to which parameter(s) they refer
